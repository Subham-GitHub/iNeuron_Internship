-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Histogram for delivery time records.
	
	first of we have to consider bin size according to requirements,
	like if we need to make a bin of 0-1 day delivery we have to use '1',
	when 2-5 then use '5' and 6-9 then use '9'.

	we have to make column(say frequency) have 1,5,9,... value in it as per required and then proceed towards data analysis options
  from data ribbon,After that a pop window will open up requiring data(select desired data) to plot the bar chart using bins(select the frequency column)
  and select the space where we have to generate the bins and bin size column in the sheet and select the graph to be ploted in desired worksheet/workbook.

	Make changes in columns generated to show exact things in the chart.
	
	Now copy the chart to the dashboard.

2. Prepare Sale and profit records.

	a) Distinct product category: In the main sheet of records we have to check the distinct items from the category columns. To get that we have used the
  advanced sort and filtering options from the data ribbon and reflect it in other column and copy that distnict product and use it in our working space 
  sheet where we have to apply fitters based on the conditions or apply combinations of filters. 
  
  ***Same has to be done for Months and Regions for our different charts like monthly and region wise sales visuals.***

	b) Use of drop down menu for category listing: In dashboard we have to create a dropdown menu to select from the category, so we have to insert the 'Combo Box' 
  from controls option found under Developer ribbon, using that we can select the list from the dropdown box. To activate this we have to right click on the Combo Box
  and go to the format control where we can see the input range(range which has to be shown in drop down list) and
  cell link(cell refelct the index value for the selected item), using cell link value we can formulate the sales, profit and order records dynamically when we change
  the drop down list in the dashboard.
